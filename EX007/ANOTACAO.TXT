SEMANTIC
 It's about the meaning of symbols and signs. It's the interpretation and what I mean by the word or code. HTML5 uses intuitive tags and words, explaining exactly what you mean and highlighting the text, styled differently than normal text eg <address> for location instead of <u>. both will highlight the text.
