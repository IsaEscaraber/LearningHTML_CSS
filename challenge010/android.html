        <h1 class="titleContentH1">Android Mascot History</h1>

        <p>
          You probably know that the <span>Android</span> operating system,
          maintained by <span>Google</span>, is one of the most used for mobile
          devices around the world. But perhaps you don't know that your
          friendly mascot has a very curious name and story? Well, follow this
          article to learn a lot about this little robot.
        </p>

        <h2 class="titleContent">The first version</h2>

        <p>
          The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a
          developer named
          <span class="contentLink"
            ><a
              href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
              target="_blank"
              >Dan Morrill</a
            ><img src="imagens/link.svg" alt="image/SVG" /></span
          >. He says he opened
          <span class="contentLink"
            ><a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a
            ><img src="imagens/link.svg" alt="image/SVG"
          /></span>
          (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of
          the robot. The objective was just to personify the system for his team
          only, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
        </p>

            type="image/png"
          />
          <img
            src="imagens/dan-droids.png"
            class="imageContent"
            alt="Flexible"
          />
        </picture>

        <p>
          This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: the
          <span>Dandroids</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="titleContent">A new mascot appears</h2>

        <p>
          The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a
          professional in the field. Russian illustrator
          <span class="contentLink"
            ><a
              href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
              target="_blank"
              >Irina Blok</a
            ><img src="imagens/link.svg" alt="image/SVG" /></span
          >, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little
          robot in a more pleasant way.
        </p>

        <picture>
          <source
            media="(max-width: 500px)"
            srcset="../challenge010/imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg" />
          <img
            src="../challenge010/imagens/irina-blok.jpg"
            class="imageContent"
            alt="irina-blok"
        /></picture>

        <p>
          Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few
          strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick
          identification with those who look at it. Then
          <span>Bugdroid</span> appeared, Android's new mascot.
        </p>

        <picture>
          <source
            media="(max-width: 820px)"
            srcset="imagens/bugdroid.png"
            type="image/png"
          />
          <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="imgBugdroid" alt="Flexible" />
        </picture>

        <p>
          The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's features came from those
          little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of
          each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in
          the Google office and looked towards the bathrooms and the
          identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

            <p>
              Another curious issue regarding Android is that each version has
              always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from
              version 1.5 to 9.0.

              Unfortunately, <span>Android Q</span> did not exist, as Google
              decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using
              numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.
