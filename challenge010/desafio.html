      <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>
      <p>
        You probably know that the Android operating system, maintained by
        Google, is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But
        perhaps you don't know that your friendly mascot has a very curious name
        and story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little
        robot.
      </p>
      <h2>The first version</h2>
      <p>
        The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a
        developer named Dan Morrill. He says he opened Inkscape (free software
        for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The
        objective was just to personify the system for his team only, there was
        no request from the company to create a mascot.
      </p>

          media="(max-width: 824px)"
          srcset="imagens/dan-droids-pq.png"
          type="image/png"
        />
        <img src="imagens/dan-droids.png" alt="Flexible" />
      </picture>
      <p>
        This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: the
        Dandroids.
      </p>
      <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a
        professional in the field. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google
        employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more
        pleasant way.
      </p>
      <picture>
        <source
          media="(max-width: 824px)"
          srcset="imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg"
          type="image/png"
        />
        <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Flexible" />
      </picture>
      <p>
        Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few
        strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick
        identification with those who look at it. Then Bugdroid appeared,
        Android's new mascot.
      </p>
      <picture>
        <source
          media="(max-width: 824px)"
          srcset="imagens/bugdroid.png"
          type="image/png"
        />
        <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="Flexible" />
      </picture>
      <p>
        The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's features came from those
        little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of
        each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the
        Google office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification
        was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

          Another curious issue regarding Android is that each version has
          always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version
          1.5 to 9.0.

            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, Android Q did not exist, as Google decided to put an
          end to this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise
          to Android 10.
