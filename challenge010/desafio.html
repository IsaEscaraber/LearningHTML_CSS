      <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>
      <p>
        You probably know that the <span>Android</span> operating system,
        maintained by <span>Google</span>, is one of the most used for mobile
        devices around the world. But perhaps you don't know that your friendly
        mascot has a very curious name and story? Well, follow this article to
        learn a lot about this little robot.
      </p>
      <h2>The first version</h2>
      <p>
        The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a
        developer named
        <span class="contentLink"
          ><a
            href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
            target="_blank"
            >Dan Morrill</a
          ><img src="imagens/link.svg" alt="image/SVG" /></span
        >. He says he opened
        <span class="contentLink"
          ><a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a
          ><img src="imagens/link.svg" alt="image/SVG"
        /></span>
        (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of
        the robot. The objective was just to personify the system for his team
        only, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
      </p>

        />
        <img src="imagens/dan-droids.png" alt="Flexible" />
      </picture>
      <p>
        This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: the
        <span>Dandroids</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a
        professional in the field. Russian illustrator
        <span class="contentLink"
          ><a
            href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
            target="_blank"
            >Irina Blok</a
          ><img src="imagens/link.svg" alt="image/SVG" /></span
        >, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot
        in a more pleasant way.
      </p>
      <picture>
        <source
          media="(max-width: 824px)"
          srcset="imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg"
          type="image/png"
        />
        <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Flexible" />
      </picture>
      <p>
        Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few
        strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick
        identification with those who look at it. Then
        <span>Bugdroid</span> appeared, Android's new mascot.
      </p>
      <picture>
        <source
          media="(max-width: 824px)"
          srcset="imagens/bugdroid.png"
          type="image/png"
        />
        <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="Flexible" />
      </picture>
      <p>
        The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's features came from those
        little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of
        each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the
        Google office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification
        was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

          Another curious issue regarding Android is that each version has
          always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version
          1.5 to 9.0.

          Unfortunately, <span>Android Q</span> did not exist, as Google decided
          to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbering, which
          gave rise to Android 10.
